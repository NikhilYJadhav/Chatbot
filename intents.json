        "A highly selective admissions process.\nA focus on cohorts or ‘classes’ of startups rather than individual companies.\nMentoring or other business training.\nIntense and time-limited support, usually lasting between three and 12 months.\nAccelerators may be funded by venture capital investors, public bodies or large corporates, depending on structure and objective. They also often tend to focus on supporting technology-based or digital startups.\n\nMost programmes encourage a high degree of peer-to-peer learning, so that founders can learn from others in similar circumstances. Mentoring from experienced entrepreneurs also plays a significant role in most programmes. The provision of funding (sometimes in exchange for equity), a workspace, facilitated networking and educational seminars/workshops are other common services.\n\nOne of the world’s first seed accelerator programmes – which is often credited as having sparked the wider accelerator movement – is the California-based Y Combinator. This program provides advice, access to networks and seed funding in exchange for an equity stake (typically $120k for 7 per cent). It has helped to develop more than 1,400 technology companies, including many now-familiar firms such as Dropbox, Airbnb, Coinbase and Reddit, and the combined worth of Y Combinator ‘graduates’ was estimated at a value of over $80 billion in June 2017. This accelerator has set the benchmark for others and has informed a lot of Nesta’s work in the field."

You also gain access to a network of alumni who have been where you were.\nThis allows you to quickly build a virtual Rolodex of professionals you can collaborate with.\nLast but not least is mentorship.\nThe best startup accelerators and incubators bring on mentors and advisors who’re at the top of their industries. They’ve already built successful startups and have valuable experience which can help you avoid several hurdles they’ve faced."
